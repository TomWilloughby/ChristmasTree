# Rendering
Give each l-system instance the knowledge of how to render each character in its alphabet.
This allows changing line lengths and colours for each l-system.

# Technical
Explore whether it's possible to use frame buffers with the window so we don't need to worry about background colours and erasing the hdc - we just take an entire buffer and display it.
